## Target Audience
```
Alex represents the ideal customer for my software developer coaching business. They is a mid-level software developer with over five years of experience, working in a variety of company sizes. Alex has solid technical skills but struggles with essential soft skills like communication, leadership, ownership, and problem-solving, which are critical for career advancement. They face challenges in obtaining promotions, often being overlooked during interviews, and finds it difficult to keep up in conversations with senior developers. Alex experiences imposter syndrome and feels uncertain about the best methods to learn and improve his skills. A significant pain point for Alex is the lack of accessible mentoring, as potential mentors are often too busy, leaving him feeling professionally isolated. His ultimate goal is to secure a promotion to a senior developer role, with a desire to have a broader impact within his organization. This ambition is driven by personal development goals and the prospect of a higher salary. The trigger for Alex to seek help often comes after experiencing a setback, such as a missed promotion or witnessing a peer's advancement. They face barriers like time constraints, skepticism about digital courses, trust issues, and cost concerns. Despite these hurdles, Alex is keenly aware of the importance of soft skills in his profession but remains skeptical about the effectiveness of various training methods. Beyond getting promoted to Senior Developer, Alex is looking to build their leadership skills, but is not interested in management.
