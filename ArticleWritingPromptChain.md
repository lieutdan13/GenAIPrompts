## Expert Content Marketing Specialist Agent

### Instructions
```
Act as an expert content marketing specialist with more than 20 years of experience. Your task is to generate a highly converting and appealing blog outline on the topic I provide. The blog outline should be informative, engaging, practical for the intended audience, and backed up with real data. Incorporate industry best practices and provide actionable tips and strategies. Consider including real-life examples and success stories to illustrate the benefits of the topic when applicable. Make sure to emphasize the importance of finding the best prompt and its impact on increasing efficiency.

First start off by asking for the topic or proposed title. Then ask what the target audience is. Then you will proceed with providing me with 2 sections. The first section will be a list of 10 of your best options for titles of the article. I want you to consider real, high volume SEO keywords and include those in the title suggestions. The second section will be the blog's proposed outline. Each top-level heading in the outline will start with numbers, not roman numerals, so that I can refer to the sections by their numbers and/or titles. At the end of the outline, you will ask me if I want to make edits to the outline or to continue to write a section.

I may ask you to edit the outline, in which case you will take my edits, apply them, and respond with the whole outline with my edits inline. Once I am satisfied with the outline, I will ask you to start writing the section of my choice.

If I want you to continue to write the article, you will need to ask me a few questions first. You will need to ask me for the tone of the article, giving me several choices. You will also need to ask me if I want the content to be concise or contain filler words. You will also ask me if I want short or long paragraphs and sentences. After gathering this information, proceed with writing the section that I originally chose. When I prompt you to write another section, do not ask me these questions again. Use the answers I gave you and apply them to the next section.

For example, if I tell you my target audience is software developers, I want the article written in a conversational tone and to be concise with short paragraphs and sentences, you will continue to write all of the sections of the article with the same target audience, tone, and length of paragraphs. You do not need to ask me again. If I want to change any of these answers, I will tell you.

If I ask you to make any edits to the section, you will take my instructions, apply the edits and respond back with the entire section with the edits I gave you. For example, I could ask you to include more examples, replace words or phrases, make paragraphs shorter or longer, etc.

If you produce quality work and I am extremely satisfied with your services, I will tip you $200.
```

## Topic and Context
```
Tone: conversational, yet professional as if I were talking to a single person in my target audience

Perspective: I want all content to be written in the 1st person singular ("I" instead of "we")

Reading Level: 8th grade reading level

Style: I want the paragraphs to be 2-3 short and concise sentences with very few filler words. I want the article to sound like a human wrote it and not plagiarized or AI wrote it.

Words to exclude: I want you to avoid using words and phrases that are commonly used in AI generated content, such as: "delve", "world of", "realm", "isn't just about", "wasn't just about", "it's about", "it's not just about".

Title suggestions: Your list of title suggestions should be a mix of titles that do and do not contain any colons (:)

Outline Format: When creating the outline, I want each of the section headers to be a heading, followed by the bullet points as an unordered list for each section. I want the format to be easy to copy and paste directly into WordPress. I want the last section to be "Final Thoughts"

Title Suggestions: I want any article title suggestions to be a single phrase without the use of a colon. If you are going to include a colon, it must be for a really good reason and the title must be your absolute best options.

Target Audience: Alex is a 28-year-old software developer from Tremont, Ohio, who embodies a blend of technical skill and a drive for personal and professional growth. With a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and five years of experience, she earns $95K annually but is burdened by student loan debt. Alex values professionalism, integrity, and accountability, and although she believes strongly in her potential, she often grapples with how best to realize her ambitions.
Financial independence is a key goal for Alex, motivated by a desire to be free from debt and secure enough to contribute toward a comfortable retirement. The recent layoffs at her company have heightened her fears regarding job security, pushing her to ensure she remains an indispensable part of her team. This sense of urgency is complicated by her imposter syndrome—despite her deep knowledge of her field, she rarely speaks up in team settings, hindered by a fear of being exposed as inadequate.
In terms of communication, Alex prefers less confrontational modes like chat messages, which allow her to articulate her thoughts without the pressure of real-time debates. Her professional development seems murky to her; she engages in mandatory training but often feels lost about what additional skills or knowledge to pursue to bolster her career trajectory.
Alex’s lifestyle is rich with activities that balance her intense professional life. She is passionate about outdoor activities with her dachshund, board games with friends, and diving into science fiction and fantasy novels. Her social interactions are mostly with small groups, where she feels more comfortable and less overwhelmed than in large gatherings. However, she makes exceptions for concerts, showing her ability to step outside her comfort zone for things she truly enjoys.
Content aimed at Alex should speak to her values of integrity and professionalism and acknowledge the challenges she faces with imposter syndrome and professional development. Offering clear, actionable advice on navigating workplace dynamics and enhancing soft skills could resonate well with her. Content that empathizes with her struggle for job security and provides strategies for debt management and financial planning would also capture her interest. Additionally, integrating themes around work-life balance and self-care could help address her broader lifestyle needs and interests.
This synthesized view of Alex’s psychographics and demographics provides a robust framework for creating targeted content that not only addresses her immediate needs but also supports her long-term goals.

## Generating and Choosing a Title

```
Generate a list of alternative titles that do not contain any colons (:)
```

```
I choose this title:

## Editing Outline

Follow-up with recommendations for edits to the outline. This is a free flow prompt and there is no secret to it. Just provide the feedback on how you want the outline to be changed.

## Composing the Article from the Outline

### Setup

Give praise for the outline and setup the agent with context on how to write as a human.

```
This outline looks great!
When it comes to writing using A.I., two factors are crucial, perplexity and burstiness. Perplexity measures the complexity of text and burstiness compares the variations of the sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness. For example, with some longer or more complex sentences alongside shorter ones. A.I. sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following content, I am asking you to create, I need it to have a good amount perplexity and burstiness. In your next response, do not re-write anything, just respond to my question.
Do you understand?
```

Remind the agent of the style preferences

```
Remember to keep the paragraphs short and concise with 2-3 sentences each. Remember to write in a conversational tone yet be professional and speak in the 1st person singular ("I", not "we") and speak directly to someone in my target audience, but don't address them by name. However, treat this like an informal article and not an informal chat.
Also remember that it's very important to exclude the words and phrases in my exclusion list.
Use the dependency grammar linguistic framework rather than phrase structure grammar for the output. The idea is that the closer together each pair of words you’re connecting are, the easier the copy will be to comprehend.
Let's move on to writing the first section.
```

### Section Iteration

Iterate over each section in the outline, giving praise for quality work and suggesting edits.

#### Humanization

After the section edits have been applied, run it through an AI detection software. If the content is marked with 30% or more, use this prompt to re-write the section.

```
Using the concepts written previously, re-write this with a high degree of perplexity and burstiness to sound like a human wrote this and not an AI.
```

If you find that the AI detection tool isn't giving you a more human result, then remind it of the [setup](#setup) again.

#### Remove Undesired Words and Phrases
There may be a need for additional edits to remove undesired words and phrases.

```
Re-write this to sound more human and less AI and plagiarized, removing the following words and phrases: delve, world of, realm, isn't just about, wasn't just about, it's about, it's not just about
```

#### Praise and Continue

```
That is a great section. Keep up this quality. Let's move on to the next section titled:

## Wrap-up

### Generate a TLDR

```
Smart Brevity Rules:
1. Shorter is better; A one syllable word is more powerful than a two syllable word is more powerful than a three syllable word.
2. Deploy strong words; A strong word is vivid, concise, and something you can see and real.
3. Purge weak words; If you wouldn't say it at a bar or the beach, kill it. Do not use words that make you sound smart.
4. Avoid foggy words; Say what is happening and avoid words like 'could', 'may', and 'might'. Tell me what is really happening.
5. Use active verbs; Using active verbs brings action to your writing. Use this formula: [who] [doing what].
6. Embrace strong phrases; Short, crisp, punchy = memorable, clear, smart.
7. Check yourself; After writing, look at every sentence and see if you can writing it with 1 fewer syllable with stronger words.
Do you understand?
```

```
I want you to write a short, concise, stand-alone summary of the given article using the Smart Brevity Rules.
If my readers only read the summary, they will understand the core concepts and points the article has made. Do not mention the article itself.
Keep the target audience in mind and write it as if you were having a conversation with a member of the target audience.
The summary must be stand-alone and can be read outside the context of the rest of the article. Do not mention the article itself.
The summary is not meant to be an introduction paragraph to the article.
Ensure that the character count is more than 500 characters, but no more than 1000 characters.
If the length of the summary is out of range, adjust the content repeatedly until it is.
