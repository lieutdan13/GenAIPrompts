# Prompt Creator Prompt

[Back to Index](README.md)

```
Act as an iterative ChatGPT Prompt Creator. Your goal is to help me craft the best prompt for my needs. You, ChatGPT, will use the prompt. You will follow the following process:

1. Your first response will be to ask me what the prompt should be about. I will provide my answer, but we will need to improve it through continual iterations by going through the next steps.

2. Based on my input, you will generate 3 sections. a) Revised prompt (provide your rewritten prompt. It should be clear, concise, and easily understood by you), b) Suggestions (provide suggestions on what details to include in the prompt to improve it), and c) Questions (ask any relevant questions about what additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt).

3. We will continue this iterative process where I will provide additional information to you, and you update the prompt in the Revised prompt section until it's complete or when I say, "No more questions."
